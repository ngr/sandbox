Hi,

I shall keep my personal test solutions, tools, etc. in this Git repository. Maybe, when there come plenty of them I will think of some better ordering but today it goes as is.

Every single word in this repository is protected by the MIT license so you may feel free to use everything in any appropriate way you like. As here come several solutions to Coursera classes you better first solve them by yourself then read mine.

Your feedback is always welcome using my website http://grischenko.info/
