[12:54] <grishchenko> hi guys! Still can't solve LinearRegression with multi params. :(
[12:55] <grishchenko> as far as i understand, to calculate h(x) value (which should be a real number each iteration or a 47x1 vector) I need smth like this:
[12:55] <grishchenko> h_of_X = theta' .* X;
[12:57] <grishchenko> this really gives me a result, but looks like some wrong result, because if I use it later the overall result differs from the correct (calculated with Normal Equations)
[12:58] <grishchenko> AND Octave floods me with warning 'automatic broadcasting operation applied'
[12:58] <grishchenko> Could you please help me undestand what's wrong?
[12:59] <grishchenko> P.S. theta is [0;0;0], X is 47x3 matrix (with 1s in the first column).
